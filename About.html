        <h1>Computer Programming - Basics</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            We assume you are well aware of English Language, which is a well-known Human Interface Language. English has a predefined grammar, which needs to be followed to write English statements in a correct way. Likewise, most of the Human Interface Languages (Hindi, English, Spanish, French, etc.) are made of several elements like verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, propositions, and conjunctions, etc. <br> <br>
            Similar to Human Interface Languages, Computer Programming Languages are also made of several elements. We will take you through the basics of those elements and make you comfortable to use them in various programming languages. These basic elements include −
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Programming Environment</li>
            <li>Basic Syntax</li>
            <li>Data Types</li>
            <li>Variables</li>
            <li>Keywords</li>
            <li>Basic Operators</li>
            <li>Decision Making</li>
            <li>Loops</li>
            <li>Numbers</li>
            <li>Characters</li>
            <li>Arrays</li>
            <li>Strings</li>
            <li>Functions</li>
            <li>File I/O</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            We will explain all these elements in subsequent chapters with examples using different programming languages. First, we will try to understand the meaning of all these terms in general and then, we will see how these terms can be used in different programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            This tutorial has been designed to give you an idea about the following most popular programming languages −
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C Programming</li>
            <li>Java Programming</li>
            <li>Python Programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A major part of the tutorial has been explained by taking C as programming language and then we have shown how similar concepts work in Java and Python. So after completion of this tutorial, you will be quite familiar with these popular programming languages.

        <h2>THE TOP 10 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES TO LEARN CODING</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>C</h3>
        <p>C is designed specifically for use with the Windows OS and is part of the .Net framework. It is widely used by competitive programmers owing to the fact that it is extremely fast and stable.</p>
        <h3>C++</h3>
        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and more. It supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.</p>
        <h3>java</h3>
        <p>Java is one of the languages that is popular in large organizations thanks to it a number of use-cases and has long been the preferred go-to language for coding on Android. It is widely used in Android App Development.</p>
        <h3>python</h3>
        <p>Python is considered one of the best programming languages that can be used for web and desktop applications, GUI-based desktop applications, machine learning, data science, and network servers.</p>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a core programming language for powering the World Wide Web. Its effectiveness in front- and back-end development, the ability to work well with other languages, versatility, and updated annually make it a widely used language.</p>
        <h3>MATLAB</h3>
        <p>MATLAB is used widely in the Computer Vision and Image processing industry. It started out as a matrix programming language where linear algebra programming was simple. MATLAB is Ideal for developing scientific research applications. Matlab Coder allows converting code for use in other programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python.</p>
        <h3>Kotlin</h3>
        <p>Kotlin is designed to be completely interoperable with Java. This language offers features that developers ask for since the time Android announced it as its first language. Kotlin effortlessly combines object-oriented and functional programming features within it.</p>
        <h3>Dart</h3>
        <p>Dart is a client-optimized language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and can be compiled to the ARM and x86 architectures for mobile use or transpiled to JavaScript for browser applications.</p>
        <h3>Swift</h3>
        <p>Swift can be friendly to new programmers. It is a safe, fast, and interactive programming language that integrates the best in modern language expertise with wisdom from the wider Apple engineering culture and the diverse contributions from its open-source community.</p>
        <h3>D</h3>
        <p>D is well suited to writing medium to large scale million line programs with teams of developers. This programming language is easy to learn, provides many capabilities to aid the programmer, and is well suited to aggressive compiler optimization technology.</p>
